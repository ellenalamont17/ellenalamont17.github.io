The Willamette River begins in Eugene, OR at the confluence of the McKenzie, Middle Fork, and Coastal Fork rivers and flows 187 miles northward to the Columbia River, where it accounts for ~1/6th of the Columbia's total flow volume. Due to large volumes of annual precipitation [(>60 in/yr)](https://web.archive.org/web/20141209051249/http://pnwho.forestry.oregonstate.edu/site/index.php) in the Pacific Northwest, the Willamette River floods often, requiring regular monitoring. Currently, the USGS operates five stream monitoring gauges along the Willamette River (Harrisburg, Corvallis, Albany, Salem, and Portland).\n","\n","![Willamette River Map](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/ce/Willamette_river_map_new.png)\n","\n","Location map of the Willamette River and its major tributaries [(1)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Willamette_River).\n","\n","The Willamette drainage basin was created by progressive and on-going tectonic processes and has been dramatically modified by volcanism and massive ice age flood events (e.g. Missoula Floods). Volcanic- and flood-based soils have made the Willamette basin one of the most fertile agricultural regions in North America, long attracting indigenous tribes and eastern settles to the region. More thebn 70% of Oregon's population lives in the Willamette Valley [(2)](https://web.archive.org/web/20141209051249/http://pnwho.forestry.oregonstate.edu/site/index.php). The flora and fauna of the Willamette Valley have shifted dramatically in recent years from forested floodplains and perennial grass prairies to less forested farmlands and vineyards, supporting the local economy. Many species in teh region are now endangered, though the valley still supports huge biodiversity. \n","\n","### Stream Gauge Location - Willamette River at Harrisburg, OR"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":6,"metadata":{},"outputs":[],"source":["# Import standard libraries\n","import subprocess           # Run new code by creating new process\n","import warnings             # Show warnings triggered by module inputs\n","from io import BytesIO      # Convert binary to human-readable format\n","\n","# Import third-party libraries\n","import folium               # Generate interactive maps\n","import hvplot as hv         # Holoview plotting tools\n","import hvplot.pandas        # Used for plotting data\n","import pandas as pd         # Used for tabular data\n","import requests             # Get data from internet has http request\n","\n","# Ignore FutureWarning coming from hvplot\n","warnings.simplefilter(action='ignore', category=FutureWarning)"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":2,"metadata":{},"outputs":[{"data":{"text/html":["<div style=\"width:100%;\"><div style=\"position:relative;width:100%;height:0;padding-bottom:60%;\"><span style=\"color:#565656\">Make this Notebook Trusted to load map: File -> Trust Notebook</span><iframe srcdoc=\"&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;\n","&lt;html&gt;\n","&lt;head&gt;\n","    \n","    &lt;meta http-equiv=&quot;content-type&quot;
