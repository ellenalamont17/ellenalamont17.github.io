(Photo Credit: Marli Miller)\n","\n","While the less populated, mostly vegetated Oregon Coast Range and local towns were most directly impacted in this storm event, the urban corridor of the Willamette valley and its infrastructure was widely impacted. Despite these impacts, the 2017 flood event was considered small in the valley's modern history, with much larger events occuring in 1861, 1890, 1945, 1956, and 1964. The 1964 flood, referred to as 'the big flood,' is the largest recorded flood event in the southern Willamette Valley.
