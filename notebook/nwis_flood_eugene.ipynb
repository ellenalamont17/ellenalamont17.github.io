Despite these impacts, the 2017 flood event was considered small in the valley's modern history, with much larger events occuring in [1861, 1890, 1945, 1956, and 1964](https://www.eugene-or.gov/1695/Flood-Hazards-in-our-Area#:~:text=Flooding%20in%20Eugene&text=The%20major%20floods%20that%20have,to%20when%20discussing%20local%20flooding.).

The Willamette River begins in Eugene, OR at the confluence of the McKenzie, Middle Fork, and Coastal Fork rivers and flows 187 miles northward to the Columbia River, where it accounts for ~1/6th of the Columbia's total flow volume. Due to large volumes of annual precipitation [(>60 in/yr)](https://web.archive.org/web/20141209051249/http://pnwho.forestry.oregonstate.edu/site/index.php) in the Pacific Northwest, the Willamette River floods often, requiring regular monitoring. Currently, the USGS operates five stream monitoring gauges along the Willamette River (Harrisburg, Corvallis, Albany, Salem, and Portland).\n","\n","![Willamette River Map](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/ce/Willamette_river_map_new.png)\n","\n","Location map of the Willamette River and its major tributaries [(1)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Willamette_River).\n","\n","The Willamette drainage basin was created by progressive and on-going tectonic processes and has been dramatically modified by volcanism and massive ice age flood events (e.g. Missoula Floods). Volcanic- and flood-based soils have made the Willamette basin one of the most fertile agricultural regions in North America, long attracting indigenous tribes and eastern settles to the region. More thebn 70% of Oregon's population lives in the Willamette Valley [(2)](https://web.archive.org/web/20141209051249/http://pnwho.forestry.oregonstate.edu/site/index.php). The flora and fauna of the Willamette Valley have shifted dramatically in recent years from forested floodplains and perennial grass prairies to less forested farmlands and vineyards, supporting the local economy. Many species in teh region are now endangered, though the valley still suports huge biodiversity. \n","\n","### Interactive map of stream gauge site"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{},"outputs":[],"source":["# Import standard libraries\n","import subprocess           # Run new code by creating new process\n","from io import BytesIO      # Convert binary to human-readable format\n","\n","# Import third-party libraries\n","import folium               # Generate interactive maps\n","import hvplot.pandas        # Used for plotting data\n","import pandas as pd         # Used for tabular data\n","import requests             # Get data from internet has http request"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{},"outputs":[],"source":["# Define the latitude and longitude coordinates for the map\n","    # Found at ('https://waterdata.usgs.gov/monitoring-location/14166000'\n","    # '/#parameterCode=00065&period=P7D&showMedian=true')\n","eugene_sg_lat = 44.27040126\n","eugene_sg_lon = -123.1737036\n","\n","# Initialize map and tweak settings\n","m = folium.Map(\n","    location = (eugene_sg_lat, eugene_sg_lon),  # Location to center display\n","    zoom_start = 12,                            # Set initial zoom level\n","    tiles = \"Stamen Terrain\",                   # Select basemap to use\n","    scrollWheelZoom=False)                      # Turns off zoom while scroll \n","\n","# Put a marker at the stream gauge location\n","folium.Marker([eugene_sg_lat, eugene_sg_lon], popup=\"Harrisburg, OR Stream Gauge\"\n",").add_to(m)\n","\n","# Display the map\n","m"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":["### Data Description and Citation\n","\n","USGS-NWIS Streamflow Data URL: \n","\n","Description: \n","\n","Discharge refers to the volume of water that passes through a given location, in this case a stream gauge, within a given period of time.
