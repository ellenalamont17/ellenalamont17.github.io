    "The city of Boise is located in a semi-arid climatic zone in the western Snake River Plain region of west-central Idaho. On average, the city receives only eleven inches of precipitation annually [(National Weather Service, 2023)](https://www.weather.gov/boi/climatesummary#:~:text=The%20semi%2Darid%20climate%20of,warm%20season%20is%20mostly%20dry.). The majority of the drinking and irrigation water feeding into Boise comes from trapped moisture and snow-melt from the mountains stored in a series of dams and canals on the Idaho and Snake Rivers.\n",

    "Recognizing both the scaricity of water but equal need for environmental and recreational greenspaces, the city of Boise, along with many partners, has been working since 2002 to develop environmentally conscious green spaces that meet the needs of the region's growing population, businesses, and native biodiversity. The city currently owns and manages 14 environmental reserves totaling nearly 5,000 acres and over 210 miles of trails [(City of Boise, 2023)](https://www.cityofboise.org/departments/parks-and-recreation/open-space/). And while the abundance of parks and green spaces already developed in the city of Boise benefit the health and wellness of residents, businesses, and communities, it remains unclear how widely the principle of green spaces is adopted within Boise's associated neighborhoods."
